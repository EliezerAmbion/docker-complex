# 📝 This defines a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) — a request for storage in Kubernetes.
# The PVC asks the cluster for 2Gi of storage that can be read and written by a single node (ReadWriteOnce).
# Kubernetes will bind this claim to a matching PersistentVolume (PV) that meets the request.
#
# 📦 AccessModes:
# - ReadWriteOnce (RWO): The volume can be mounted as read-write by only one node at a time.
# - ReadOnlyMany (ROX): The volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes simultaneously.
# - ReadWriteMany (RWX): The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes simultaneously.
# - ReadWriteOncePod (RWOP): The volume can be mounted as read-write by only one pod (Kubernetes v1.22+).
